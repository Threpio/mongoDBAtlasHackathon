# Time Series Logs API

## Made for the MongoDB Hackathon

Made for the MongoDB Atlas run by Dev: [Click me!](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-mongodb-atlas-hackathon-on-dev-4b6m)

I chose "Prime Time" as the theme for this project because I enjoy Logging and have always wanted to work with a time series database.
